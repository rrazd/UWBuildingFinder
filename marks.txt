The marking process for A4 was somewhat different than other 
assignments.  Briefly, students could submit a proposal for 
feedback.  Most people who did this (and corrected issues and 
submitted again) received 25 of the 25 marks available. Those
who didn't submit a proposal had the remaining marks re-
weighted.  Fil took the lead in this part.

Everyone's project was evaluating by a TA on the technical 
merit, primarily use of MVC.  Due to the sample code, nearly 
everyone did very well on this section.

The remaining marks were given for "execution".  Each sub-
mission was reviewed by the same three TAs, who gave a weight 
for how challenging the result was, the interactivity and 
responsiveness, visual design, robustness, and usefulness.  
These weights were used to order the assignments.  I then 
reviewed 16 assignments and gave an explicit mark for execution.  
The remaining assignments were interpolated between these marks.  
The maximum execution mark was 55 out of 50. 

The breakdown of your marks were:
	Proposal:	25	(out of 25)
	Techical:	25	(out of 25)
	Execution:	53.51	(out of 50)

The TAs occasionally made comments about assignments.  If they 
made any, they are as follows:
	* 
	* It gives driving directions... Not sensible on campus
	* some interface hickups (semi-offscreen widgets)
	* Incorrect routing

In summary, your mark for A4 was 103.51 out of 100.

If any of the above seems amiss, please email me directly at 
bwbecker@uwaterloo.ca and describe the issue.  I want to 
finalize marks on Monday, so please let me know about issues 
no later than Monday morning at 8:00am.

Most of you did a fantastic job on this assignment.  Thanks 
for your efforts.
