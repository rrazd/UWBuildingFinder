This is an ambitious assignment goal, and I would recommend reducing the scope in some way. There are some things I would recommend treating as enhancements:

+ customizing more than one aspect of the map. For example, maybe you can only customize the map with icons for start and end points.
+ integrating weather data. Using the UW Open Data API and the Google Maps API is already more than sufficient without adding additional data, and will make for an exceptional project.

That said, excellent job on the proposal.
